This blog will mainly focus on programming, computer science, and other cool related things. Hopefully my weak attempt at a pun in the title suggests this (Life in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell">Shell</a>... get it?). Anyways, my name is <a href="http://www.benrudolph.com">Ben Rudolph</a> and I like to code, learn, rock climb, cook, do gymnastics, and bike. I'm a Computer Science major at Stanford University and was formerly part of the men's varsity gymnastics team before a career ending injury.

<em>On the Origin of pennyhacks.com</em>

Pennyhacks.com originated in Hawaii when I was browsing through a trashy tourist shop and stumbled across a key-chain that had an English name and the Hawaiian equivalent. Naturally I searched for my own name and apparently Peni  means Ben in Hawaiian. But rather than name the site Penihacks for fear that people would think I'm hacking something I shouldn't, I decided to call it pennyhacks. Pennyhacks doesn't make much sense, but at the time I figured people would interpret it as "small" hacks. I realize now that this is far from obvious. Anyways, I spent 20 bucks on it so it's not going change.
