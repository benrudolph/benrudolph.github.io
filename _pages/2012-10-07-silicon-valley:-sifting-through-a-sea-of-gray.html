I'm tired. I'm tired of Silicon Valley. I'm tired of the sea of meaningless companies. I'm tired of the startup cushy culture that pervades almost every technology company here. I came to Stanford four years ago bright eyed and, yes, bushy tailed. I was amazed at all the possibilities and the awesome companies that lived in the bay area. And I soaked it all up. I became a Computer Science major and every summer I went to a different tech company. Each one served me free lunch, had giant stuffed animals, gave me loads of swag and had random fitness balls rolling around the office. Plus I was paid way more than I was worth. I loved it.

Today I went to the Stanford career fair as a senior, ready to find a full-time position. However, in contrast to my summer internships that were only 3 month stints, this full-time job is going to be the real deal, so naturally I want to find something I'm passionate about. Sometimes it's hard for me to differentiate between passion and enjoyment because often the line between them blurs, but in this case it was clear. All of my summer internships I enjoyed. I was able to sit for 8 hours happily typing away at the keyboard to code something beautiful, but none of my internships inspired passion. A desire to truly make a change in the world. A gnawing hunger to push through any obstacle to succeed. Work was always work; it never seeped beyond 5pm

As I walked through the tables at the fair, the familiar companies were all there -- eyeing my name tag with animal-like hunger that designated me as a graduating CS major, seemingly the most sought after degree right now. One of the first companies that I was pulled over by was Shopkick. The man at the table preceded to tell me what Shopkick is. A person, when the app is activated, can get coupons for items at a store they just walked into. No offense to Shopkick, as they're only an example that depicts loads of other software companies, but I stood there thinking, what would I think about my career if I worked at Shopkick for 10 years. All I could see was emptiness. I would probably spend more than 8 hours a day to do what? Make some application that allows people to get coupons? Really? But this isn't just Shopkick. This is the majority of software companies that I see at career fair. It's like a disease that has gotten ahold of all the companies. Lolapps, pocketgems making mind-numbingly boring games to what end? Yes, they all have highfalutin mission statements. Somehow they manage to twist their company's product into a world changing statement.

I talked to another company. I don't even remember the name of it, but they did something along the lines of High Frequency Trading. Is this something I'd like to devote my life to? Absolutely not. I do not exactly know what HFT involves, but it seems to me that you devote a whole lot of time to lightning fast algorithms in order to make money off the stock market. And I bet they make a lot of it.

After that whole ordeal of talking to loads of different, but the same, companies, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disgust. I worked really hard during my four years here. Am I supposed to now graduate and work at facebook so that people can look at each other's photos more easily?

Where are the <strong>real</strong> companies that are solving <strong>real </strong>problems in the world? Perhaps there are a lot out there, but not many were present at the career fair. 78 million acres of the Amazon rainforest are being lost each year, 1.5 million Syrians have already been internally displaced, according to the U.N., in the Syrian Uprising.

How could I possibly work at a company like Zynga and develop Farmville when stuff like this is still happening? Just doing a few weeks worth of research into refugee camps there are so many ways that they could be innovated and made more safe through technology, but it doesn't seem to be drawing any attention. Where are the social technology companies at the career fairs?
