Throughout my life, whenever I have become overly engrossed in some form of activity, I begin to see the world through a different lens. For example, as a kid, I loved LEGO and when I would go on a particularly long LEGO building stretch, I would begin to see my surroundings in LEGO. I would stare out the car window and see not just ordinary houses, but houses made from LEGO. I would see that LEGO house and know instantly how I could possibly render it myself in LEGO format. This sort of thing has happened multiple times over my life through various different means -- too much video games, too many puzzles and too much gymnastics.

Recently though, seeing the world through a programming lens has become the norm. No longer can I  see a stack of problems sets that need to be sorted alphabetically without having my mind scream MERGE SORT. No longer can I go to the DMV and see a grumpy worker sitting there and not think <strong>while (time &gt; 9am &amp;&amp; time &lt; 5pm) doWork()</strong>.

My favorite part about seeing the world through this programatic lens so-to-speak is when I see interesting programming  concepts embedded in real life. I guess that is just what most people call real world analogies. Here are a few of my favorites:

<strong>AJAX</strong>

Callbacks are an interesting paradigm in javascript that allow for asynchronous code, i.e. code is not run in a strictly procedural manner. One prime example of this is AJAX, which is familiar to any web developer and I'm sure most developers in general. What AJAX allows you to do is make a call to the server via a specified route, and also specify a function to handle whatever the server returns to you. When you make this AJAX call though the javascript code just keeps on truckin' along, and when the server is finally ready, the function you specified to handle the returned data will execute.

Now, take for example the Mexican restaurant called Treehouse (or your favorite semi-fast food place), I wait in line to order (javascript code running procedurally), I make my order (making an AJAX call specifying what I want from the server), I get a ticket with a number. Now I wait doing anything I'd like (javascript code running after the AJAX call), and finally the cook calls my order number and I go and grab my food and eat (handling the data sent back from the server). While this analogy falls apart at the end as I can not eat and do what I was doing while waiting, it's still pretty neat!
