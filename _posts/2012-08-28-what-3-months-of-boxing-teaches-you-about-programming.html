This summer I did a whole of programming at an awesome company called Ooyala. Along with my internship though, I also did a whole lot of boxing. I had never boxed before in my life, so it was a great experience for me. It was only natural to draw parallels between the two -- maybe this'll inspire you to learn to box, or to program, or, better yet, both!

<strong>Jab... jab... jab... CROSS!</strong>

In boxing there are two key punches that all newbies learn. The jab and the cross. The jab is like your poking stick. You fire it out quickly to test the waters and then bring it back just as fast, if not faster. The cross is your nasty knuckle sandwich. You start with a pivot on your back foot and twist your whole body until you launch your dominant arm into a cross. It's a bit slower, but way more powerful. You use your jab to make a hole in your opponent's guard, and then, when the time is right, whip out the cross.

So how does this have anything to do with programming? Well, one of the first things I learned (from experience) about boxing is that you can't release your cross right away unless you want to get walloped in the face.  Similarly, when working at a mid-size company like Ooyala, you don't want to unleash your killer new feature in one big go, or be prepared to feel the pain that is angry users from the new bugs that will inevitably pop up. At Ooyala, they home brewed their own tool to release their feature incrementally so that not every user received the new changes. This was a pretty awesome idea that none of the previous companies I worked at did. This was incredibly handy when a large feature release (something they've been working on for over a year) was finally put into production. And, what do ya know, there were some pretty critical bugs. Not to fear though, the problem was isolated to only a few users and we were able to disable the new feature on those users until the fixes were made.

<strong>Hitting the button</strong>

Getting hit on the button is one of the worst things that can happen to you  as boxer. The button is what regular people call the chin. The reason it's called the button is simple: when you get knocked in the chin it propagates to the back of your head and affects the nerves there, which in turn cause your legs to go limp (sorry for the hand wavy answer -- this is what my coach told me and what I've verified through experience). This is why boxers fall down after getting knocked in the chin hard enough. Often, when I was first sparring (let's be real it still happens) I would get hit on the button and feel a little dizzy, but my veins were so pumped with adrenaline I didn't even stop to gather myself; I just went right back at it without stopping to think, only to get brained again. Usually my coach would come in and grab me and tell me to recoup and then go in and fix what I did wrong.

This exact feeling, perhaps to a lesser degree, was replicated during my time at Ooyala. It happened when I pushed some of my code to production, only semi-confident that it was perfected. Then when a bug report came back, I would scramble and try to figure out what I messed up. My heart would start pounding and the little voice in my head would shout at me "Oh god you dumb intern you're going to screw everything up." And sure enough, I could not find out what was wrong. It was then that I would realize that I had to take a breath, keep calm, look at the problem objectively, and then dig in with a clear mind -- much more effective than method number one.

<strong>You gotta run the 700 miles, do the 1000 push-ups, and punch the 5000 punches before you can hope to box </strong>

One thing that I really liked about my coach is that he didn't just throw you into the ring and hope you made it out alive. He made sure you were ready, even if it meant doing the boring conditioning. Everyone just likes to box; it's a thrill. However, you'll get your bell rung if you're not prepared for it.

Ooyala similarly took the time to do all the boring stuff (and that's a good thing). Sure, there was plenty of crazy development going on, with 2 week sprints where you could code whatever you wanted, but there was also a focus on having a polished, crisp product. And that takes discipline. Ooyala taught me to make sure my strings were translated in all their supported locales, to make sure that not a single line went over 110 characters, to never forget my <code>nil</code> checks, and so much more that helped make their product a well-oiled machine.

You'll learn a lot boxing, seriously.
