After reading James Somers' <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write">post</a> on why everyone should write, I couldn't agree more with his points. I started writing a year back and it changed the way I thought. It forced me to structure my thoughts and define exactly how I was feeling. If something interesting was happening, I wouldn't simply throw those thoughts away. I collected them and attempted to write about it in a cohesive manner. Writing made me dig deeper into a topic so that I actually did have enough information to write.

Just as writing allowed me to engage the world at a new level, so has taking photographs. I fell in love with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork">Humans of New York</a>, where Brandon, a solo photographer, goes around New York, interacts with interesting people he sees, and then photographs them. While he is a professional grade photographer, I thought I could do the same. So I made a Humans of Stanford facebook page, gathered my courage and went out to talk to strangers. The results were remarkable. By no means were any of my pictures amazing, but the interactions I had were. I met a man who told me about how he was going to change the world and about his philosophy of "Human's Best" (can't say understand it fully though). I found two engineers exploring a playstation controller by destroying it. I learned about and practiced the art of Falun Dafa.

Photographing people makes you seek out other people. It makes you search for an interesting person to talk to. It makes you walk with your eyes open. There are so many times when I would walk from point A to point B barely keeping note of my surroundings. However, with a camera always at hand, I'm always scanning around looking for people wearing weird hats or building the next electric car. So yes, writing made me think about and question the world, but taking photos let me interact with it.
