As decision time for a summer internship rolls ever closer, I decided to reflect a little on what it takes to have a successful internship experience. I'm now looking into my 4th summer internship, and my other 3 have given me insight on what to look for on this coming one. I've tried working at a large corporation, a mid-size company, and a start-up - all have been software related. Here are a few of my thoughts:

<strong>Cool People --&gt; Cool Internship</strong>

Whether it's a huge corporation or a 3 man team, who you're with has made the largest impact for me. I don't care if you have an office like Google or pay me like (someone really overpaid.. Eric Cantor?), working with a bad team will absolutely make me not come back next year. For the most part though, I've been lucky to work with awesome teams (surprisingly enough, programmers can be very fun people). What goes into an "awesome" team? It's actually pretty simple:
<ul>
	<li>Communication - On every level, this is essential. Just stopping by my desk to see how my project is going or see how I'm doing, goes a long way to making me feel a part of the team. When explaining projects/tasks, make sure I really really understand what I'm supposed to do or at least the goal of the project (less stress for both parties).</li>
	<li>Approachability - I know interns that have brooded at their desk for weeks, stuck on some minute part of their assignment. They were simply too afraid/proud to go ask for help. This is easily solved by being open to questions - it's way easier going over to another dev team guy (who is 20x more experienced than me) to ask a question when I know I'm not going to see groans of frustration or a stupid smirk.</li>
	<li>???</li>
</ul>
Those are a few things that I've seen that makes an awesome team for me. Naturally, smaller companies have a leg-up on their behemoth corporation counterpart since a smaller group of people can most often create a tight-knit group among their developers (awkward). However, it's definitely still possible in the corporation setting. As a potential intern, look to see how they organize their developers. Do they split the developers into teams? How large are they? Do they sit near each other? In my experience, corporations that have smaller teams and work closely together, have potential to be a really great team to work with.

<strong>Don't sh*t on the intern</strong>

In my experience, I've seen many mistakes made by interns - crashing the site, erasing every user in the database (luckily it was a backup), and other various bugs. If this happens, they'll Â most likely be peeing their pants or quickly booking a "wanna get away ticket." Interns make mistakes all the time; they're in completely new environments, new people, and new code - it's bound to happen. However, how a mentor/team reacts can often define an internship. If all that's remembered is nasty emails and cursing, that probably won't bode will for that intern to come back (granted, if you still want the intern to comeback)

<strong>Projects</strong>

What an intern works on is a delicate balance between being so insignificant that it doesn't matter how badly the job is butchered and so important that if it's botched..________. Personally, I like the thrill of working on something important that has some significance (and I'd venture to say most interns feel the same).

<strong>Environment</strong>

This one can be hard to change if you're the company, but where and how I work also plays a role in the success of an internship.
