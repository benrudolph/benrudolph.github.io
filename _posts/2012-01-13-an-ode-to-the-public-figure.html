Recently I wrote a post critiquing the Stanford ml-class. Granted, it was a little harsher than intended and some of my word choices were not the best, but it ended up sparking a pretty heated debate. And on the Internet, all gloves are off. I received some pretty personal comments because of my opinion:
<blockquote> "Itseems he is not clever enough.( How he got Stanford ?????)"

"I also felt that the language this kid used to describe his experience was more what I would expect from someone in grade 7 - and NOT from a Stanford student.  "

"Yes how come he is at Stanford ????????"

"you should aspire to be an academic weenie."</blockquote>
And my favorite:
<blockquote>"Try sitting under a waterfall. This month."</blockquote>
This one was actually part of a much larger comment that was just too hateful and full of spite to approve. It was unclear whether he wanted me to drown under this waterfall or meditate under it like monks do.

Those are just a smattering of some of the responses I got, but it got me thinking about how much I would <em>not</em> want to be Sarah Palin (not that I ever wanted to be). I wrote a fairly mild post seen by a fraction of the population, and I was receiving some solid punches from the commentary on a pretty daily basis. I used to have no pity on Sarah Palin, but I have to admit she must be receiving A LOT of hate mail. There's even "I Hate Sarah Palin" <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/i+hate+sarah+palin+gifts">paraphernalia</a>. You have to admire her for still chuggin' along after the whole Alaska-Russia debacle. Waking up to dozens of comments and articles bashing her stupidity must have gotten old very quickly. She might even be a good person, but no one really takes that into account.

The Internet has made mob mentality possible without a mob. After reading/hearing some especially stinging comments about Sarah Palin, I'd have a hard time believing that they would repeat those words to her face mano a mano. The cover behind anonymity is a nice one to have when blissfully spraying your anger on person X. Even requiring a name doesn't fully uncover anonymity because the world is so darn vast it really doesn't matter if I know or don't know your name.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's up to us to maintain civility on the Internet and maybe next time I'm about to write some crude, spiteful comment, I'll think twice about it(???).
