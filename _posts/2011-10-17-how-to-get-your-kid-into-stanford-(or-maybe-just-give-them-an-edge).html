<strong>nutshell:</strong> Malcolm Gladwell claims in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Outliers</span> that the month you are born can have a direct effect on your success. I decided to test this theory here at Stanford. So I gathered up some random samples from the surrounding population, asking what month they were born in and if they were born in the United States. Since most U.S. schools start around August to September, I predicted that Stanford would see a skew towards people being born during the months of August to December. Kids that are born during these months are usually older than their fellow classmates who are born from January to July which means that the older kids have more developed brains when they first start school. Because of this, they often are put in accelerated programs which puts them at even more of an advantage. I'm testing to see if this advantage lasts until college.

<strong>what does this mean:</strong> While this alone is definitely not going to get your kid into Stanford, it could help.
